Build extension to run `dotnet list package --vulnerable` or `dotnet list package --deprecated` and fail the build on found vulnerabilities or deprecated packages.

**NOTE** Only works with .NET 5 and later.

## How to use

After installing the extension it will be available as a build task to add to your build pipelines.

After adding the task to a build pipeline you have to configure the task by setting the working directory in which to run the scan.

To add the task to a pipeline, the following options exist.

```
- task: NuGetVulnerabilityScan@1
  inputs:
    type: 'vulnerable'
    path: '${Build.SourcesDirectory}'
    transitive: true
    level: 'high',
    warning: false
```
