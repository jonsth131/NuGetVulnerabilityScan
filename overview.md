Build extension to run `dotnet list package --vulnerable` and fail the build on found vulnerabilities.

**NOTE** Only works with .NET 5 and later.

## How to use

After installing the extension it will be available as a build task to add to your build pipelines.

After adding the task to a build pipeline you have to configure the task by setting the working directory in which to scan for vulnerabilities, and the minimum level the task will fail at. The default level is set to High.

To add the task to a pipeline, the following options exist.

```
- task: NuGetVulnerabilityScan@1
  inputs:
    path: '${Build.SourcesDirectory}'
    transitive: true
    level: 'high'
```
